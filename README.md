# 🚧 Toll Booth Management System – DAA Project

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course. It simulates a Toll Booth Management System where the shortest path to toll booths is calculated using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. The system helps vehicles reach toll booths using the most efficient routes in terms of distance or time.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Design a toll booth system that models the road network as a weighted graph. Use **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the shortest path from the vehicle's entry point to each toll booth. The goal is to minimize overall travel distance/time.

## ✅ Features

- Graph-based road network input
- Calculates shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Displays optimal path and cost from source node
- Interactive command-line interface
- Python implementation for ease of use

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Language**: Python 3  
- 📊 **Data Structures**: Dictionary, Min-Heap (heapq), Adjacency List  
- ⚙️ **Algorithm**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Greedy approach)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Save the program as `toll_booth_dijkstra.py`
3. Open terminal or command prompt in the project directory
4. Run the program:

```bash
python toll_booth_dijkstra.py
